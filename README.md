- **JsonHandler**: Serializes and deserializes JSON data for communication with the server.
- **ServerSocket**: Provides socket functionality for the server.
- **SQLiteDatabase**: Manages the SQLite database for storing messages.
- **ClientRequestHandler**: Handles client requests and interacts with the database.
- **JsonHandler**: Serializes and deserializes JSON data for communication.
- **TcpClientRequestHandler.h**: Defines the class responsible for handling client requests over TCP connections.
- **HttpClientRequestHandle.h**: Defines the class responsible for handling client requests over HTTP connections.
- **index.html**: Provides the front-end interface for the mail client application.
